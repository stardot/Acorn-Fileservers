Level 3 File Server v1.33
=========================

At v1.33 both the Level3 and Filestore File Server were seperate source code
sets. Some work was started to merge both \L3 and \Filestore under one common
code base \Fileserver which used an option at assembly time for the version
required. This work has now been completed and the disc contains the merged
source code from which it is possible to assemble either target binary.

Assembling the File Server Source Code
======================================

There are two variant discs available, a 640K ADFS disk for BBC and a 800K
ADFS disc for RISC OS. This is due to space constraints. The only difference
is the RISC OS emulator and GO batch file is omitted from the BBC disc. 

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. This will give the user the 
option to either assemble a binary for Level3 use (BBC, non-CMOS processor)
or a binary for the Filestore ROM. 

The assembled file "FS" (for Level3) or "FSRom" (for Filestore) will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.33
============

Date - estimated Sep-Dec 1988.

Comments
========
The code is based on the changes made to the differences between the Filestore 
v1.31 and v1.33 binaries and applying them to the shared code base so they can 
be applied to both variants.

Changes (from v1.31) (Fileserver source files)
====================
(L3) Level changes only
(FS) Filestore changes only
(++) shared code change
