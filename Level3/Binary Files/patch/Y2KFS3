		   Y2K Fix for Acorn Level 3 Fileserver		   ====================================		Date: 28-Dec-1998 - Version 1.00 for v0.92		Date: 20-Jan-2018 - Version 1.00 for v1.25		        J.G.Harston - jgh@mdfs.net		70 Camm Street, Walkley, Sheffield, S6 3TRThese patches alter the Acorn Level 3 fileserver code to allow the use ofdates after 1996. This also allows the use of dates after 1999. In keepingwith the 'Short Acorn Era', any two-digit year 00 to 80 is defined asbeing 2000 to 2080. Any two-digit year from 81 to 99 is defined as being1981 to 1999.The patches alter FS3 version 0.90 and FS3 version 1.24. Before running, acopy of the FS code must be made, called FS3v092 or FS3v125. This can bedone with *MOVE FS FS3v092 or *MOVE FS FS3v125 on the Master.On all systems, with the 6502CoPro switched on, the following will createa copy of FS:	*GO F800	*LOAD FS	*SAVE FS3v092 400+86CE	or *SAVE FS3v125 400+84BEOnce a copy is made, you can run Y2KFS3v92 or Y2KFS3v125 to patch it. Youshould also change one line of WFSInit to allow creation of new fileserverdisks after 1996 as follows:Change: 3310 X%=EVALz$:UNTILX%>=85:=(((X%-81)*4096)+(Y%*256)+z%)AND&FFFF    to: 3310 X%=1900+EVALz$:X%=X%-100*(X%<81):UNTILY%+z%:=(((X%-81)*4096)+		(Y%*256)+z%+((X%-81)AND&F0)*2)AND&FFFFThe 'Short Acorn Era' defines years as a 7-bit offset from 1981, giving afull range of 1981 to 2108. As on startup only a single century range canbe entered the effective range is 1981 to 2080.The only parts of the fileserver that deal with dates in strings areentering the date at startup, displaying the status line and displayingfile information with *INFO. In all other parts, the date is stored as abinary 7-bit offset from 1981.The full list of changes is as follows:* Version 0.90 is now version 0.92* Version 1.24 is now version 1.25* Version 0.92 allows startup entry of years from 1981 to 2080* Version 1.25 reads the startup date from the RTC with OSWORD 14* Status line date displays years after 1996 correctly* Years after 1996 in *INFO reports are displayed correctly* Dates are displayed as dd/mm/yy instead of dd:mm:yy.Also included is the program StartFS3. Running this with FSv092 will readthe date from any Real Time Clock present, and start up the fileserver andenter the date automatically, leaving the user to enter the number ofdrives and the number of stations.
