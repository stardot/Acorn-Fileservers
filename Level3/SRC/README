Level 3 File Server v1.07
=========================

This disc contains a recreation of the source code for the Acorn Level 3 
File Server. It has been achieved by using the original binary and the 
source code from v1.06. 

Assembling the File Server Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "FS" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.07
============

Date - estimated about May 1987. Only one change comment dated 20/5/87

Comments
========
The version widely distributed having the version number v1.07 is the same as 
v1.06 except it is assembled for the RTC dongle being absent. The differences 
are the version number and the serial number in the binary.

The code has been updated to include the date fix as an assembly option in 
file Uade01. 
Y2KPAT * 0 ; no(=0) Apply the JGH Patch (=1)
