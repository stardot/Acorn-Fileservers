Level 3 File Server v1.04
=========================

This disc contains a recreation of the source code for the Acorn Level 3 
File Server. It has been achieved by using the original binary and the 
source code from v1.06.

Assembling the File Server Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "FS" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.
