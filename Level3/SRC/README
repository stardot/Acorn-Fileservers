Level 3 File Server v1.31
=========================

This disc contains the original source code for the Acorn Level 3 file server.

Assembling the File Server Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "FS" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.31
============

Date - estimated July 1988. Dates in change comments since v1.24 include 
4/29 April 1988, 22 May 1988, 1 Jun 1988 and 1/7/20 July 1988.

Comments
========
This is the original and unchanged source code. Since just before v1.20 the 
FileStore had become an ACORN product which used the same code base as the Level3 file server. The original disk had 3 directories
 - L3 containing the Level3 file server code
 - FileStore with the File Store file server code for the new E01 Filestore
 - FileServer which appears to be an unfinished or incomplete set of code that   
   merges the Level3 file server and FileStore file server code base.

Many thanks to Jon Thackray for discovering these long-lost sources and making
them available to the Acorn community.
