		   Y2K Fix for Acorn Level 3 Fileserver		   ====================================		     Date: 28-Dec-1998 - Version 1.00		   J.G.Harston - jgh@arcade.demon.co.uk		70 Camm Street, Walkley, Sheffield, S6 3TRThis patch alters the Acorn Level 3 fileserver code to allow the use ofdates after 1996.  This also allows the use of dates after 1999.  Inkeeping with the 'Short Acorn Era', any two-digit year 00 to 80 is definedas being 2000 to 2080.  Any two-digit year from 81 to 99 is defined asbeing 1981 to 1999.Before running, a copy of the FS code must be made, called FS3-092.  Thiscan be done with *COPY FS FS3-092 on most filing system other than DFS. On DFS *COPY will not allow you to use a different destination name.On all systems, with the 6502CoPro switched on, the following will createa copy of FS:	*GO F800	*LOAD FS	*SAVE FS3-092 400+86CEOnce a copy is made, you can run Y2KFS3 to patch it.  You should alsochange one line of WFSInit to allow creation of new fileserver disks after1996 as follows:Change: 3310 X%=EVALz$:UNTILX%>=85:=(((X%-81)*4096)+(Y%*256)+z%)AND&FFFF    to: 3310 X%=1900+EVALz$:X%=X%-100*(X%<81):UNTILY%+z%:=(((X%-81)*4096)+		(Y%*256)+z%+((X%-81)AND&F0)*2)AND&FFFFThe 'Short Acorn Era' defines years as a 7-bit offset from 1981, giving afull range of 1981 to 2108.  As on startup only a single century range canbe entered the effective range is 1981 to 2080.The only parts of the fileserver that deal with dates in strings areentering the date at startup, displaying the status line and displayingfile information with *INFO.  In all other parts, the date is stored as abinary 7-bit offset from 1981.The full list of changes is as follows:* The version number is now 0.92* Allows startup entry of years from 1981 to 2080* Status line date displays years after 1996 correctly* Years after 1996 in *INFO reports are displayed correctly* Dates are displayed as dd/mm/yy instead of dd:mm:yy.Also included is the program StartFS3.  Running this will read the datefrom any Real Time Clock present, and start up the fileserver and enterthe date automatically, leaving the user to enter the number of drives andthe number of stations.
