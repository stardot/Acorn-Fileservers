Comments
========
J.G.Harston released a fix in Dec 1998 for v0.90 to allow the use of dates 
after 1996. This patched the above mentioned v0.90 Pre-Release IV.05 or
"BARSON COMPUTERS" binary.

The code has been updated to include the fix as an assembly option in file
Uade01. 
Y2KPAT * 0 ; no(=0) Apply the JGH Patch (=1)

Changes
=======
Option for assembly with date fix (file Uade01)
The version number is now 0.92 (file Uade01)
Allows startup entry of years from 1981 to 2080 (file Uade04)
Status line date displays years after 1996 correctly (file Uade04)
Years after 1996 in *INFO reports are displayed correctly (file Uade04)
Dates are displayed as dd/mm/yy instead of dd:mm:yy (file Uade0E)

Version 0.90 Pre-Release IV.05
==============================

Date - estimated. May-Oct 1985 (possibly 4 May from the pre-release version). 
       Two comments are dated after that date but with code included in the 
       binary. The comments could have been added at a later date to already
       existing code or versions were kept the same but the code was different.
       That would date the code to Oct 1985. There are changes labelled 
       15/12/85 that are not in this binary. The assembler directive file FSASM
       has the comment updated by Glenn 8/5/85.

* FS3-090  - Dongle absent
  FS3-090b - Dongle absent. BARSON COMPUTERS variant

Comments
========
There are two Trace debug pieces of code in the final binary although the 
DEBUG directive is set to 0 (file Uade14) and the binary performs a simple RTS
when it is called.

There is also a version of the same code with the banner displaying BARSON
COMPUTERS. Barson were one of Acorn's distributors in Australia and it looks
like the branding was probably done by hex editing the binary directly rather 
than altering the code.

Changes
=======
No previous version to compare to.
