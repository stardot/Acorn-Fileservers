Version 0.90 Pre-Release IV.05
==============================

Date - estimated. May-Oct 1985 (possibly 4 May from the pre-release version). 
       Two comments are dated after that date but with code included in the 
       binary. The comments could have been added at a later date to already
       existing code or versions were kept the same but the code was different.
       That would date the code to Oct 1985. There are changes labelled 
       15/12/85 that are not in this binary. The assembler directive file FSASM
       has the comment updated by Glenn 8/5/85.
       
Binary Files (* denotes the official ACORN released version)
============
* FS3-090  - Dongle absent
  FS3-090b - Dongle absent. BARSON COMPUTERS variant

Comments
========
There are two Trace debug pieces of code in the final binary although the 
DEBUG directive is set to 0 (file Uade14) and the binary performs a simple RTS
when it is called.

There is also a version of the same code with the banner displaying BARSON
COMPUTERS. Barson were one of Acorn's distributors in Australia and it looks
like the branding was probably done by hex editing the binary directly rather 
than altering the code.

Changes
=======
No previous version to compare to.
