; Issue SCSI Command to Hard Drive
;
; This routine runs through the phases of a SCSI transfer:
; - selection phase:  selects the target device (based on the drive number)
; - command phase:    sends the command from the control block to the target
; - data phase:       transfers data blocks between the target and initiator
; - status phase:     reads the status code from the target
; - message-in phase: checks for the COMMAND_COMPLETE message from the target
;
; In addition, if the status code is CHECK_CONDITION (02), then a REQUEST SENSE
; command is issued to retrieve additional SENSE DATA about the error.
;
; On Entry:
;    DISCCB/DISCCB+1 point to the control block containing the SCSI command
;
; On Exit:
;    A = the status code
;    Z = 1 and A =  00 indicates success
;    Z = 0 and A /= 00 indicates failure

; Wait for the SCSI target to assert REQ* or de-assert BSY*
;
; All information transfer (command, data or status) over the data bus
; between the initiator and target is controlled by the target. The
; target transfers one byte at a time using handshaking with the REQ*
; and ACK* lines.
;
; The target asserts REQ* to start a transfer and the initiator
; responds with ACK* to acknowledge the transfer. On transfers from
; the target to the initiator the target asserts the data before
; asserting REQ* and waits until ACK* is asserted before sending the
; next byte. On transfers from the initiator to the target the target
; asserts REQ* and waits until ACK* is asserted before reading the
; data from the bus.
;
; On exit:
;   N is the control/data status bit
;      N = 0 indicates the target expects data information to be transferred
;      N = 1 indicates the target expects control information to be transferred
;
;   V is the input/output status bit
;      V = 0 indicates the target expects the initiator to do an output operation
;      V = 1 indicates the target expects the initiator to do an input operation
;
; Note: an asserted SCSI signal is seen as a '1' in the status register
; because the signals are passed through inverting buffers.
