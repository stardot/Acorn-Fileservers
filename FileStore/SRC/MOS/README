FileStore MOS ROM v1.23
=======================

This disc contains the source code for the Acorn FileStore E01 MOS ROM.

Assembling the File Store Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "MOSrom" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.23
============

Date - estimated August 1987. The last changes in the source code are dated 
8 Aug 1987. The FileStore E01 is advertised in Acorn User magazine in July 
1987 which may have been for pre-orders. The FileStore with serial number 0001
had v1.23 fitted although that may have been a replacement for intial test
firmware. The AcornUser show in 1987 was 23-26 July and may be where Acorn
revealed the first machines.

26/6/87 is when the pseudo directory symbols were added.
24/7/87 
8/8/87 appears to be the date of the last changes.

Comments
========
The MOS source code has been recreated from scratch using sources which 
included the DNFS source code. It creates a full matching binary, however,
some of the variable and routine names are guesses.

The FileStore MOS ROM appears to keep versioning in line with NFS versions.
BBC NFS is 3.34, DNFS reports 3.60. This has 3.3C.

The MOS ROM still has debug code present. This was probably due to leaving the
assembler debug directive on before release code was produced.

The original file server FSmake that puts together the assembled parts has been
adapted to put together the MOS parts. It first writes a &FF byte from 0 to
&6800 and then adds the assembled code to create a full 32K ROM file instead of
only the assembled code.

This is the initial release version of the FileStore E01 MOS ROM.
