FileStore MOS ROM 3.66
======================

This disc contains the source code for the Acorn FileStore E01 MOS ROM. This is
the MOS to accompany the v1.33 FileServer ROM.

Assembling the MOS Source Code
==============================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "MOSrom" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.33
============

Date - estimated Sep-Dec 1988.

Comments
========
The MOS source code has been recreated from scratch using sources which 
included the DNFS source code. It creates a full matching binary, however, 
some of the variable and routine names are guesses.

The FileStore MOS ROM appears to keep versioning in line with NFS versions.
BBC NFS is 3.34, DNFS reports 3.60. This has 3.66. The main changes appear to
be around optimising the handling of interrupts.

The original file server FSmake that puts together the assembled parts has been
adapted to put together the MOS parts. It first writes a &FF byte from 0 to
&6800 and then adds the assembled code to create a full 32K ROM file instead of
only the assembled code.

Depending on the options used, the FS ROM can overflow the 32K ROM as was the
case in later versions. There is space at the start of the MOS ROM for the
overflow but care must be taken with the start of workspace areas.
The file MAKEROMS will take any overflow bytes and add them to the start of the
MOS ROM, create a 32K FSROM, 32K MOSROM (for E01 filestores) and a single 64K
E01SROM (for E01S filestores). Copy both the FSROM and MOSROM into the same
directory, and run the program under Turbo Hi-BASIC.
