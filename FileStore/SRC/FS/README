FileStore FS ROM v1.23
======================

This disc contains the source code for the Acorn FileStore E01 file server ROM.

Assembling the File Store Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "FSROM" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.23
============

Date - estimated August 1987. The last changes in the source code are dated 
8 Aug 1987. The FileStore E01 is advertised in Acorn User magazine in July 
1987 which may have been pre-orders. The FileStore with serial number 0001
had v1.23 fitted. The AcornUser show in 1987 was 23-26 July and may be where
Acorn revealed the first machines.

26/6/87 is when the pseudo directory symbols were added.
24/7/87 
8/8/87 appears to be the date of the last changes.

Comments
========
The file server ROM code has been created using the original v1.31 FileStore
file server source code and the original Level3 file server v1.06 source code.

There is support for the Pseudo directory symbols (%, &, @) which was turned
off in later releases. The file server software also has a big buffer cache
option introduced for replies using the Cachesw switch which is set to no in
the original release.

The original file server FSmake that puts together the assembled parts has been
altered to insert 512 bytes at the start of the ROM so the image is ready
for use directly. This maps to 512 bytes of zero page workspace as the ROM
code executes from address 0x200.

This is the initial release of the FileStore E01 file server ROM.
