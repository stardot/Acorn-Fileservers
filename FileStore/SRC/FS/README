FileStore FS ROM v1.31
======================

This disc contains the original source code for the Acorn FileStore E01/E01S
file server ROM.

Assembling the File Store Source Code
======================================

The source code will assemble on either a BBC with an Acorn Turbo (256K) 
6502 Co-Processor and ADFS or on Arthur/RISC OS using the 6502 Turbo 
Co-Processor emulator which is included here.
To assemble on a BBC, use SHIFT-BREAK or *EXEC !BOOT. On RISC OS, double 
clicking the file GO will start the process. The assembled file "FSROM" will be
placed in the root directory. The assembly process is significantly faster 
when a hard drive is used instead of a floppy.

Version 1.31
============

Date - estimated 20/7/88. This was the latest date of a comment in the code.
The E01S first appeared in Technomatic adverts in Acorn User Jan 1989.

Comments
========
The file server ROM is the original and unchanged source code. Since just 
before v1.20 the FileStore had become an Acorn product which used the same 
code base as the L3 fileserver. 

The original file server FSmake that puts together the assembled parts has been
altered to insert 512 bytes at the start of the ROM so the image is ready
for use directly (if less than 32K). This maps to 512 bytes of zero page
workspace as the ROM code executes from address 0x200. 

An ammendement has been made at the end of the code to add some bytes to the
file server ROM. When the file server code was originally assembled, it
appears that when creating a ROM, some noise was picked up from code already
on the disk. These few bytes have been replicated at the end, so a binary 
compare to an original ROM is correct.

v1.31 was the first release for the revised Acorn FileStore E01S model.
The E01S uses 1 x 64K ROM instead of 2 x 32K ROMs. There is no difference in
the code between the two systems.

From the Acorn parts list there was a release between v1.23 and v1.31. A binary of this has not been found. There wasn't a corresponding MOS ROM and it is
assumed only the file server ROM had the revision at this point.

                                                        DATE 21.5.90

0254,206-01   FILESTORE FILESERVER ROM V 1.2A

v1.31 is not listed in Acorn parts list.

Depending on the options used, the FS ROM can overflow the 32K ROM as was the
case in later versions. There is space at the start of the MOS ROM for the
overflow but care must be taken with the start of workspace areas.
The file MAKEROMS will take any overflow bytes and add them to the start of the
MOS ROM, create a 32K FSROM, 32K MOSROM (for E01 Filestores) and a single 64K
E01SROM (for E01S Filestores). Copy both the FSROM and MOSROM into the same
directory, and run the program under Turbo Hi-BASIC.
*CB
CHAIN "MAKEROMS"
The program can be found with the MOS ROM disk.

Warning: There appear to be changes made to the file system handling over 
previous versions. It has been found that hard drives from previous versions
are not fully compatible with v1.31 - both L3 and FileStore.

Changes (from v1.23) (FileServer)
=================================

The Filestore software has a big buffer cache option introduced for replies
which is enabled in this version.

Support for Pseudo directory symbols is no longer present, but kept as an
optional assembler directive. The same for the MOS ROM debug code.
Command line changes:
Old Version   New command and syntax
*FORMAT       *FSFORMAT <4|5> <NAME>
*FSMODE       *FSMODE <U|M>
*VERIFY       *FSVERIFY d
*FSSTN        *FSSTATION sss
*MAXDRIVE     *FSMAXDRIVE d
*FSUSER       *FSUSER <name>
*FSPROT       *FSPROT <ON|OFF>
*REPORT       *FSREPORT

New Commands are 
*PRPAGE <Y|N>
*FSNAMEDISC <name>

Commands removed are
*CAT
*LOAD
*SAVE
*CERTIFY

Form Feed suppression option (*PRPAGE). Bypass flag in CMOS for the Acorn copyright hard drive check. SIN added to disc error report strings.
Year 20xx compatable, bugfix enlarging the password file. Support for multiple
hard drives and E40S, E60S. Reset CMOS to default values if they are corrupt.
A revised version of the AFS0 disk format is used to optimise use of the larger
hard drives. Disks and floppies with the older AFS0 format will have issues.
